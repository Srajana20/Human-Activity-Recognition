# Human-Activity-Recognition
## Overview
This project aims to develop and deploy an optimized human activity recognition model on a low-power edge device.

## Introduction
Activity recognition is a versatile technology with applications in various fields such as healthcare and activity monitoring. Our work focuses on developing algorithms to accurately monitor older individuals' daily activities using accelerometer data.

## Problem Statement and Objectives
### Problem Statement
Development and deployment of an optimized human activity recognition model on low-power edge devices.

### Objectives
- Develop and optimize a human activity recognition model for efficient performance on low-power edge devices.
- Deploy the optimized model on the Adafruit Feather M0 Adalogger.
- Interface the Adafruit Feather M0 Adalogger with an accelerometer sensor (MPU6050) to collect real-time data.

## Dataset Description
The dataset: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/anshtanwar/adult-subjects-70-95-years-activity-recognition<Br>
The dataset consists of data from 15 older adults wearing 2 accelerometers for 40 minutes on their right thigh and back. The activities include walking, shuffling, ascending and descending stairs, standing, sitting, and lying.

## System Design
The system is divided into three modules: development, optimization, and deployment. Each module focuses on different aspects of the model creation and deployment process.

## Implementation
### Development Module
Development of the initial model using TensorFlow.
### Optimization Module
Optimization of the model using techniques such as quantization to reduce size and increase efficiency.
### Deployment Module
Deployment of the optimized model on the Adafruit Feather M0 Adalogger and interfacing with the MPU6050 accelerometer.
